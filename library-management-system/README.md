# Project Overview
We'll develop a Library Management System with the following features:

- Book Management: add, remove, and view books.
- Member Management: register, remove, and view members.
- Borrowing System: members can borrow and return books.
- User Roles: Differentiate between librarians and regular members.
- Data Persistence: save and load data from files.

# This project will cover
- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Packages and Modules
- Exception Handling
- File I/O
- Command-Line Interfaces
- Setting Up the Environment

Before we start coding, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.
We'll use **Python 3.8** or higher for this project.

# Recommended Tools

- Code Editor: IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, VSCode or any text editor.
- Version Control: Git (optional but recommended).

# Project Structure
Organizing your project files is crucial. Here's the structure we'll follow:

```
library_management_system/
├── library/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── book.py
│   ├── member.py
│   ├── librarian.py
│   └── library.py
├── data/
│   ├── books.json
│   └── members.json
├── main.py
└── requirements.txt
```
- library/: Contains all class definitions.
- data/: Stores JSON files for data persistence.
- main.py: Entry point for the application.
- requirements.txt: Lists any external dependencies similar to pom file in maven.

# Step 1: Creating the Basic Classes
We'll start by defining the fundamental classes: Book and Member.

### 4.1. Book Class

File: library/book.py

#### library/book.py

```
class Book:
    def __init__(self, book_id, title, author, copies):
        self.book_id = book_id
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.copies = copies

    def __str__(self):
        return f"ID: {self.book_id}, Title: '{self.title}', Author: {self.author}, Copies: {self.copies}"
```
Explanation:

##### Attributes:

* book_id: Unique identifier for the book.
* title: Title of the book.
* author: Author's name.
* copies: Number of available copies.

##### Methods:

* __init__: Constructor to initialize a book object.
* __str__: String representation for easy printing.

### 4.2. Member Class
File: library/member.py

##### library/member.py

```
class Member:
    def __init__(self, member_id, name, email):
        self.member_id = member_id
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.borrowed_books = []

    def borrow_book(self, book):
        self.borrowed_books.append(book)

    def return_book(self, book):
        self.borrowed_books.remove(book)

    def __str__(self):
        borrowed = ', '.join([book.title for book in self.borrowed_books]) or 'None'
        return f"ID: {self.member_id}, Name: {self.name}, Email: {self.email}, Borrowed Books: {borrowed}"
```
Explanation:

##### Attributes:

* member_id: Unique identifier for the member.
* name: Member's name.
* email: Member's email address.
* borrowed_books: List of books the member has borrowed.

##### Methods:

* borrow_book: Adds a book to borrowed_books.
* return_book: Removes a book from borrowed_books.
* __str__: String representation for easy printing.

# Step 2: Implementing Inheritance
We'll introduce a Librarian class that inherits from Member, differentiating user roles.

### 4.3. Librarian and Member Subclasses
File: library/librarian.py

#### library/librarian.py

```
from .member import Member

class Librarian(Member):
    def __init__(self, member_id, name, email, employee_id):
        super().__init__(member_id, name, email)
        self.employee_id = employee_id

    def add_book(self, library, book):
        library.add_book(book)

    def remove_book(self, library, book_id):
        library.remove_book(book_id)

    def __str__(self):
        base = super().__str__()
        return f"{base}, Employee ID: {self.employee_id} (Librarian)"
```
Explanation:

##### Inheritance:
Librarian inherits from Member, gaining all its attributes and methods.

##### Additional Attributes:
employee_id: Unique identifier for the librarian.

##### Additional Methods:

* add_book: Adds a book to the library.
* remove_book: Removes a book from the library.

##### Overridden Methods:
__str__: Enhances the string representation to indicate the role.

# Step 3: Managing Books and Members
We'll create a Library class to manage books and members.

### 4.4. Library Class
File: library/library.py

#### library/library.py

```
import json
from .book import Book
from .member import Member
from .librarian import Librarian

class Library:
    def __init__(self):
        self.books = {}      # key: book_id, value: Book instance
        self.members = {}    # key: member_id, value: Member or Librarian instance

    def add_book(self, book):
        if book.book_id in self.books:
            self.books[book.book_id].copies += book.copies
        else:
            self.books[book.book_id] = book

    def remove_book(self, book_id):
        if book_id in self.books:
            del self.books[book_id]
        else:
            raise ValueError("Book ID not found.")

    def register_member(self, member):
        if member.member_id in self.members:
            raise ValueError("Member ID already exists.")
        self.members[member.member_id] = member

    def remove_member(self, member_id):
        if member_id in self.members:
            del self.members[member_id]
        else:
            raise ValueError("Member ID not found.")

    def borrow_book(self, member_id, book_id):
        if member_id not in self.members:
            raise ValueError("Member ID not found.")
        if book_id not in self.books:
            raise ValueError("Book ID not found.")
        book = self.books[book_id]
        member = self.members[member_id]
        if book.copies < 1:
            raise ValueError("No copies available.")
        book.copies -= 1
        member.borrow_book(book)

    def return_book(self, member_id, book_id):
        if member_id not in self.members:
            raise ValueError("Member ID not found.")
        if book_id not in self.books:
            raise ValueError("Book ID not found.")
        book = self.books[book_id]
        member = self.members[member_id]
        if book not in member.borrowed_books:
            raise ValueError("This book was not borrowed by the member.")
        book.copies += 1
        member.return_book(book)

    def list_books(self):
        return list(self.books.values())

    def list_members(self):
        return list(self.members.values())
```
Explanation:

##### Attributes:

* books: Dictionary to store books with book_id as keys.
* members: Dictionary to store members and librarians with member_id as keys.

##### Methods:

* add_book: Adds a book or updates copies if it exists.
* remove_book: Removes a book by book_id.
* register_member: Registers a new member or librarian.
* remove_member: Removes a member by member_id.
* borrow_book: Allows a member to borrow a book.
* return_book: Allows a member to return a book.
* list_books: Returns a list of all books.
* list_members: Returns a list of all members.

# Step 4: Creating Packages

Organizing code into packages improves maintainability. We've already set up the library package.
Ensure the library directory has an __init__.py file to be recognized as package.

File: library/__init__.py

#### library/__init__.py

```
from .book import Book
from .member import Member
from .librarian import Librarian
from .library import Library
```
This allows us to import classes directly from the library package.

# Step 5: Adding Methods and Functionality
We'll enhance the Library class with more robust methods and add functionality for data persistence.

### 4.5. Organizing Code into Packages
Ensure the library package is correctly organized, as shown earlier. This step is already covered in Step 4.

### 4.6. Library Methods
We've already added essential methods in the Library class. Next, we'll implement data persistence.

# Step 6: Handling Exceptions
Proper error handling ensures the program runs smoothly and provides meaningful feedback.
Example: Handling Borrowing Errors
In the borrow_book method, we raise ValueError when issues arise. We'll handle these exceptions in the user interface.

# Step 7: Building a User Interface
We'll create a simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) to interact with the library system.

### 4.7. Command-Line Interface
File: main.py

#### main.py

```
from library import Book, Member, Librarian, Library
import json

def main():
    library = Library()
    load_data(library)

                print("Data saved. Exiting...")
                break

            else:
                print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

        except ValueError as ve:
            print(f"Error: {ve}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")


def load_data(library):
    try:
        with open('data/books.json', 'r') as f:
            books_data = json.load(f)
            for b in books_data:
                book = Book(**b)
                library.add_book(book)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("books.json not found. Starting with an empty book list.")

    try:
        with open('data/members.json', 'r') as f:
            members_data = json.load(f)
            for m in members_data:
                if m.get('employee_id'):
                    member = Librarian(**m)

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("members.json not found. Starting with an empty member list.")

def save_data(library):
    books_data = [vars(book) for book in library.list_books()]
    with open('data/books.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump(books_data, f, indent=4)

    members_data = []
    for member in library.list_members():
        members_data.append(vars(member))
    with open('data/members.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump(members_data, f, indent=4)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```
Explanation:

* Main Menu: Presents options to the user for different operations.
* Input Handling: Takes user input to perform actions.
* Exception Handling: Catches and displays errors gracefully.
* Data Loading and Saving: Reads from and writes to JSON files for persistence.
* User Roles: Differentiates between librarians and regular members when adding/removing books.

# Step 8: Persisting Data
We'll use JSON files to save and load data, ensuring information isn't lost between sessions.

### 4.8. Saving and Loading Data
In main.py, the load_data and save_data functions handle data persistence.

#### Key Points:

##### Loading Data:
Tries to read books.json and members.json.
If files don't exist, starts with empty lists.

##### Saving Data:
Converts book and member objects to dictionaries using vars().
Writes data to JSON files with indentation for readability.
File: data/books.json and data/members.json

These files will be created automatically when you run the program and perform add operations.

# Step 9: Final Touches and Testing
Before deploying, ensure all functionalities work as expected.

Testing Steps:

Add a Librarian:

Choose option 3.
Indicate the user is a librarian.
Provide necessary details.
Add Books:

Choose option 1.
Use the librarian ID created earlier.
Add multiple books.
Register Members:

Choose option 3.
Indicate regular members.
Borrow and Return Books:

Choose options 5 and 6.
Ensure the borrowed books are reflected correctly.
List Books and Members:

Choose options 7 and 8 to verify data.
Remove Books and Members:

Choose options 2 and 4.
Verify removal by listing.
Exit and Restart:

Ensure data persists after restarting the application.

### Potential Enhancements:
Search Functionality: Allow searching books by title or author.
GUI Interface: Build a graphical user interface using Tkinter or PyQt.
Advanced Permissions: Implement more detailed user roles and permissions.
Database Integration: Use a database like SQLite for data management.

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You've built a fully functional Library Management System in Python, covering essential OOP concepts
such as classes, objects, inheritance, and more. Here's what you've learned:

* Classes and Objects: Defined Book, Member, and Librarian classes.
* Inheritance: Created a Librarian class that inherits from Member.
* Encapsulation: Managed access to data through class methods.
* Packages and Modules: Organized code into a library package.
* Exception Handling: Handled errors gracefully in the CLI.
* File I/O: Persisted data using JSON files.
* Command-Line Interface: Built an interactive CLI for user interaction.

This project serves as a strong foundation for further exploration into Python and software development.
You can expand upon it, integrate more features, or use it as a stepping stone for larger projects.

### Next Steps:

* Refactor Code: Improve code structure and add docstrings.
* Implement Testing: Write unit tests using unittest or pytest.
* Explore Advanced Topics: Delve into topics like multithreading, networking, or web development with frameworks like
  Django or Flask.

### Tips:

you can use @classmethod for making static methods in class and @dataclass annotation to mark as domain class
